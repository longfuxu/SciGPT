4. Key message:

- (1): The research question of this article is to review the recent progress in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) for structural studies of dynamic biological macromolecules. The introduction emphasizes that the cryo-EM method has become one of the most powerful tools to solve the structure of biomolecules at near-atomic resolution, accompanied by X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and it can be used for structure determination of isolated biomolecular complexes across a wide molecular mass range while capturing multiple dynamic states.
 
- (2): The article discusses the basic procedures, the two modalities, and model building including recent advances in cryo-EM for structural studies of dynamic biological macromolecules. Sample preparation and image acquisition for cryo-EM are detailed in the article, including sample vitrification, low dose data acquisition, and model building.
 
- (3): The key experiment in this study is cryo-EM, which can determine the three-dimensional structure of biomacromolecules in near-native condition at close to atomic resolution, and has the potential to reveal conformations of dynamic molecular complexes. The data are analyzed by using advanced image-processing algorithms such as single particle analysis and electron tomography.
  
- (4): The results support the research question that cryo-EM is a powerful tool for the investigation of biological macromolecular structures including analysis of their dynamics. The key experiment discussed in this article provides evidence that cryo-EM can be used to determine the three-dimensional structure of biomacromolecules in near-native condition and has the potential to reveal conformations of dynamic molecular complexes.
5. Methods: 

- (1): Instrumentation: The article employs cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) that uses electron microscopes capable of operating at cryogenic temperatures. This allows the imaging of biological macromolecules in vitrified ice to avoid radiation damage.

The sample preparation includes purification of the macromolecules, vitrification, and grid preparation. The experimental procedures for cryo-EM include low dose data acquisition, single particle analysis, electron tomography, and model building. Advanced image processing algorithms and model refinement techniques are used for data analysis.





1. The significance and novelty of this research lie in its review of the recent progress in cryo-electron microscopy for structural studies of dynamic biological macromolecules. The introduction emphasizes its potential as a powerful tool complementary to X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy for determining structures of isolated biomolecular complexes across a wide molecular mass range.

2. The knowledge gap in this field is the need for structural determination of dynamic macromolecules in near-native conditions at close to atomic resolution. The research question is interesting due to the potential benefits of cryo-EM for effectively imaging and analyzing these biomolecules. As the preservation of the biological sample is critical for their function, cryo-EM can be used to study them in their native state, and thus has revolutionized the field of structural biology.

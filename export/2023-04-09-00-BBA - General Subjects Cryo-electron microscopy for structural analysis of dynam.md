4. Key message:
- (1): The research question of this article is to provide an overview of the cryo-electron microscopy method and introduce contemporary studies to investigate biomolecular structure and dynamics, including examples from the recent literature. The knowledge gap in this field is highlighted in the introduction as the need for techniques to study the dynamics of biological entities in their native environment, which is challenging but provides a richer insight into their behavior.
- (2): The article discusses the sample preparation and image acquisition procedures for cryo-EM, highlighting the vitrification process used to preserve biological specimens at near-native conditions within a thin amorphous ice film. Two modalities for 3D data acquisition and reconstruction, single particle analysis (SPA), and subtomogram averaging (STA) are introduced.
- (3): The key experiment is the use of cryo-EM to determine the three-dimensional structure of biomolecules in close to native conditions at close to atomic resolution. The data are analyzed using advanced image-processing algorithms, and the method has become even more widely applicable with present-day single particle analysis and electron tomography.
- (4): The results of the study support the research questions by demonstrating the applicability and potential of cryo-EM for the investigation of biological macromolecular structures, including the analysis of their dynamics. The ability to observe structures in their near-native environment provides novel insights into dynamic molecular complexes.
5. Methods: 

- (1): Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) instrumentation was used, including a transmission electron microscope equipped with a field-emission gun and a liquid-helium-cooled cryo-specimen holder. A direct electron detector with a high dynamic range was also utilized.
 
- (2): Biological samples for cryo-EM were prepared using various techniques, including single-particle cryo-EM, cryo-electron tomography, and subtomogram averaging. Samples included purified proteins, protein complexes, and cellular organelles. Samples were prepared using vitrification to preserve biological specimens at near-native conditions within a thin amorphous ice film.
 
- (3): Experimental procedures involved the acquisition of cryo-EM images, data processing, and 3D reconstruction. Cryo-EM images were collected at various magnifications and with varying electron doses. The collected data were processed using advanced image-processing algorithms, including the use of helical symmetry for filamentous structures. Two modalities for 3D data acquisition and reconstruction, single particle analysis (SPA), and subtomogram averaging (STA), were utilized to determine the structure of biological macromolecules.
